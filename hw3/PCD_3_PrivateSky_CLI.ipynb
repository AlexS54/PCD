        "PrivateSky, developed by the Faculty of Computer Science at UAIC Iași, is a decentralized platform designed to handle secure data exchanges and storage. It is built upon the OpenDSU model, which offers several advantages that justify its use in this project:\n",
        "\n",
        "- End-to-End Privacy: All data is encrypted by default, and only authorized users can decrypt and modify it.\n",

        "- Decentralization: Data is stored in a distributed fashion without relying on centralized servers, reducing attack surfaces.\n",
